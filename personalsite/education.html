                <p>
                    I am currently a Software Engineering (B.S.) student at Brigham Young University - Idaho in Rexburg, Idaho. My current emphasis is in two different types of engineering, Software Design 
                    and Full Stack Web Development. I currently am in my junior year of University and have a 4.0 GPA as of the time that this is being written for the website. Based on my current rate of 
                    progress and the remaining coursework in front of me, it is estimated that I will be graduating with my degree in July 2026. Prior to my time here at BYU-I, received an Associate Degree 
                    with High Honors in University Studies from Utah Valley University in May 2023, where I also had a 4.0 GPA.

                    As a very hard worker with a strong work ethic, I have my fair share of accomplishments, although some are definitely more impressive than others. I will focus on the more noteworthy ones 
                    on this page. When I was 13 years-old, I earned my Eagle Scout and set the record within my troop for the quickest to earn it. While an engineering student in High School, I won the 2018 
                    Utah Technology Student Association competition and represented Utah at the national competition. Most recently, I earned a full tuition scholarship from BYU-I and have been able to 
                    maintain it due to my grades. As I earn more accolades, I will be sure to note them here.
