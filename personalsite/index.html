                    Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Nicholas Wilkins and I am the creator and administrator of this website. I was born and raised in South Jordan, Utah as the 3rd of 8 children. 
                    I married the love of my life in the summer of 2021 and we are expecting our first child later this spring. I have worked in the financial industry for the last four years, but I am 
                    currently working on transitioning my skillset to a new industry - software engineering.  I currently have experience in web development with HTML/CSS, database design and interactions 
                    with MySQL, and programming in Python.
