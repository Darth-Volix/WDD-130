                    Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Nicholas Wilkins and I am the creator and administrator of this website. I was born and raised in South Jordan, Utah as the 3rd of 8 children. 
                    I married the love of my life in the summer of 2021 and we are expecting our first child later this spring. I have worked in the financial industry for the last four years, but I am 
                    currently working on transitioning my skillset to a new industry - software engineering.  I currently have experience in web development with HTML/CSS, database design and interactions 
                    with MySQL, and programming in Python.

                <p>
                    The goal of this website is to build a portfolio website that showcases my skills and personality, and that attracts the attention of potential employers and clients. I want to demonstrate 
                    my proficiency and attention to detail in HTML/CSS, as well as other languages that I will learn along the way. I also want to use this website to display my flexibility and creativity 
                    with design. This website will be updated and expanded as needed while I continue to grow, learn, and develop skills within the industry and at school. For more information on my education
                    and projects, please see their respective pages via the navigation bar.
