      <h5>About Me</h5>
      <p>
        Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Nicholas Wilkins and I am the creator and administrator of this website. I was born and raised in South Jordan, Utah as the 3rd of 8 children. 
        I married the love of my life in the summer of 2021 and we are expecting our first child later this spring. I have worked in the financial industry for the last four years, but I am 
        currently working on transitioning my skillset to a new industry - software engineering.  I currently have experience in web development with HTML/CSS, database design and interactions 
        with MySQL, and programming in Python. 
      </p>
      <h5>Goal of This Website</h5>
      <p>
        The goal of this website is to build a portfolio website that showcases my skills and personality, and that attracts the attention of potential employers and clients. I want to demonstrate 
        my proficiency and attention to detail in HTML/CSS, as well as other languages that I will learn along the way. I also want to use this website to display my flexibility and creativity 
        with design. This website will be updated and expanded as needed while I continue to grow, learn, and develop skills within the industry and at school. For more information on my education
        and projects, please see their respective pages via the navigation bar.

      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <h5>CSE 110 - Introduction to Programming</h5>
      <p>
        This course is the first course taken by Software Engineering students here at Brigham Young University - Idaho. The purpose of this course is to teach students the fundamentals of
        programming using the interpretive and easy to learn language known as Python. Each week, the coursework and projects get progressively more difficult. The one that gave me the most 
        trouble out of all of them was one that is based on the game Wordle, and I have included an image of the running and completed program below. The hardest part was combining my 
        knowledge of lists and comparing inputs to the  winning word from the list. Once that was figured out, the rest was easy!
      </p>
      <h5>WDD 130 - Web Fundamentals</h5>
      <p>
        This course is also taken by every new Software Engineering Student at Brigham Young University - Idaho. This course covers the basics of website design and development using HTML 
        and CSS. The initial learning of HTML/CSS is extremely difficult, but luckily there is plenty of opportunity to overcome humps in the course. Throughout the semester there are two large 
        projects undertaken - a guided one to build a white water rafting website and one where we build our own personal website, which is the website you are now looking at. Below, I have 
        included an image of the website I created for the guided project.

      <h3>Education</h3>
      <h5>Educational Background</h5>
      <p>
        I am currently a Software Engineering (B.S.) student at Brigham Young University - Idaho in Rexburg, Idaho. My current emphasis is in two different types of engineering, Software Design 
        and Full Stack Web Development. I currently am in my junior year of University and have a 4.0 GPA as of the time that this is being written for the website. Based on my current rate of 
        progress and the remaining coursework in front of me, it is estimated that I will be graduating with my degree in July 2026. Prior to my time here at BYU-I, received an Associate Degree 
        with High Honors in University Studies from Utah Valley University in May 2023, where I also had a 4.0 GPA.
      </p>
      <h5>Accomplishments and Achievements</h5>
      <p>
        As a very hard worker with a strong work ethic, I have my fair share of accomplishments, although some are definitely more impressive than others. I will focus on the more noteworthy ones 
        on this page. When I was 13 years-old, I earned my Eagle Scout and set the record within my troop for the quickest to earn it. While an engineering student in High School, I won the 2018 
        Utah Technology Student Association competition and represented Utah at the national competition. Most recently, I earned a full tuition scholarship from BYU-I and have been able to 
        maintain it due to my grades. As I earn more accolades, I will be sure to note them here.

      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        The colors of the elements will be drawn from the color palette listed in the site
        plan.
        The Header and Footer will be fixed in place while the rest of the page can scroll.
        Each image and paragraph card will be given shadow effects and borders to create a 
        sense of dimension. The images in the footers will be icons with links to my social
        profiles. The image in the top left of the nav is the logo.
