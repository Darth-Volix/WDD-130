                    This course is the first course taken by Software Engineering students here at Brigham Young University - Idaho. The purpose of this course is to teach students the fundamentals of
                    programming using the interpretive and easy to learn language known as Python. Each week, the coursework and projects get progressively more difficult. The one that gave me the most 
                    trouble out of all of them was one that is based on the game Wordle, and I have included an image of the running and completed program below. The hardest part was combining my 
                    knowledge of lists and comparing inputs to the  winning word from the list. Once that was figured out, the rest was easy!

                    This course is also taken by every new Software Engineering Student at Brigham Young University - Idaho. This course covers the basics of website design and development using HTML 
                    and CSS. The initial learning of HTML/CSS is extremely difficult, but luckily there is plenty of opportunity to overcome humps in the course. Throughout the semester there are two large 
                    projects undertaken - a guided one to build a white water rafting website and one where we build our own personal website, which is the website you are now looking at. Below, I have 
                    included an image of the website I created for the guided project.
