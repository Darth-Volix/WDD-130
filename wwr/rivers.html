                        The River Styx, also known as the river of hate, is one of the most prominent features of the Greek underworld, or Hades.
                        According to ancient mythology, the river is a personification of the goddess Styx, who is the daughter of the primordial 
                        deities Oceanus and Tethys, and the mother of several powerful forces, such as Victory, Strength, and Force. Styx was the 
                        first to ally with Zeus in his war against the Titans, and as a reward, he made her river the ultimate oath for the gods. 
                        Any god who swears by the water of Styx and breaks their promise will suffer severe consequences, such as losing their voice 
                        and power for nine years. The water of Styx is also believed to have the ability to grant invulnerability to anyone who 
                        bathes in it, as in the case of the hero Achilles, whose mother dipped him in the river as a baby. However, she held him by 
                        his heel, which remained his only weak spot, and he was later killed by an arrow that hit him there. The River 
                        Styx is not the only river in Hades, but it is the most important one, as it forms the boundary between the world of the
                        living and the world of the dead. The souls of the deceased have to cross the river to enter the underworld, but they need 
                        to pay a toll to the ferryman Charon, who transports them on his boat. 
                        The customary payment is a coin that is placed in the mouth of the corpse by their relatives or friends. If the dead have 
                        no coin, they are doomed to wander on the shore of the river for a hundred years, until they find another way to cross. 
                        The river also circles the underworld seven times, creating a barrier that prevents the souls from escaping. The river is 
                        dark, cold, and turbulent, and it is filled with rapids, whirlpools, and waterfalls. Along its banks, there are various 
                        monuments and landmarks that related to the myths and legends of the ancient Greeks, such as temples, statues, and shrines. 
                        Some of the most notable sights are the palace of Hades and Persephone, the judges of the dead, the fields of punishment and 
                        reward, and the gates of the underworld, guarded by the fearsome three-headed dog Cerberus. For safe travel, your raft for this
                        river is sealed tightly with a dome and the oars have a watertight seal in the oar holes.

                    <p>
                        The Acheron, whose name derives from the Greek word for "pain" or "woe", is both an Underworld river and a real river. In 
                        the underworld, the Acheron is one of the five rivers that flows through the realm of Hades, the god of the dead. The souls
                        of the deceased have to cross the Acheron with the aid of Charon, the ferryman who charges a coin for his service. The Acheron 
                        is also the site of the Necromanteion, a temple where the living can communicate with the spirits of the underworld. The Acheron 
                        is often depicted in media as a dark and dismal river, symbolizing the sorrow and suffering of the afterlife. The Acheron also 
                        exists in the physical world, as a river in the Epirus region of northwest Greece. It originates near the village of Zotiko 
                        and flows into the Ionian Sea near the town of Ammoudia. The river has a length of 52 km (32 mi) and a drainage area of 705 km^2^ 
                        (272 sq mi). The river is renowned for its natural beauty and ecological diversity, as it passes through gorges, wetlands, and 
                        forests. The river also offers various recreational activities, such as rafting, kayaking, hiking, and fishing. As Hades only 
                        allows rafting in the Underworld on the River Styx, our rafting tours for this river take place on the river in the physical world.
